Aegle, EMR Management in Android (Diploma Thesis)
================================================

Diploma Thesis. An EMR management Android app(complementary to the "Aegle" website).

There is also a complementary application using only NFC. This is intended for emergency personnel(e.g. Ambulance) and with the swap of an NFC tag they can access crucial information of the user, like blood type, allergies, medical conditions etc.
